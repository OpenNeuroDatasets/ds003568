This dataset contains the MEG and structural MRI data from the "Electrophysiological correlates of mood and reward dynamics in human adolescents" pre-registered analysis (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.04.433969v1).
  
The task-mmi3 data corresponds to the monetary gambling mood induction task described in the paper. Task-mmi3 data has been pre-processed marking bad channels and bad segments (motion > 5mm or/and noise artifacts). 
Task-rest data is unprocessed 10 minutes resting state scan acquired during the same scanning session. 

Anatomical MRIs have been defaced and co-registered fiducial coordinates are available in the anatomical json files. 

Data from four confirmatory subjects are not made available because of missing data sharing consent.
sub-22658 and sub-24247 do not have an available structural scan.
